# WTWR

What to wear is a simple user friendly application and it's technology makes suggestions on what to wear depending on the weather.
This project implements user auth which is a key in any application.
The weather is set by using location and implements using a weather API, in addition to another API to store data, retrieve and make changes. (CRUD)

The journey with this creation was the hardest by far but one of the most rewarding projects that I have worked on to date.

Plans for improvement.

# Utilize React Modal, and create a form component

# Implement form Validation

# Create a responsive application for multi divice optimization
